          We started Tiny Docs in 2015 to bridge the communcation gap between
          doctors, kids, and families. We can't measure success in just
          dollars and cents because a child's health is far too important. So
          instead, we dream big and measure our impact in smiles and health
          outcomes. <br /> <br /> We provide children and families with the
          tools to make informed, empowered healthcare decisions. It's
          changing the world with cartoons for any child in any language.
